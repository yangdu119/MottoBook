If you consistently do it... that's excellence.,Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"One of the reasons inequality gets so deep in this country is that everyone wants to be rich. That's the American ideal.

But I never said, 'I'm going to buy art to impress this crowd.' That's just ridiculous to me.

People have to accept that.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"I'm far from being god, but I work god damn hard.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"I'm just saying the producers and people who work on music are getting left out - that's when it starts getting criminal. It's like you're working hard, and you're not receiving. In any other business, people would be standing before Congress. They have antitrust laws against this kind of behavior.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"I treat people based on who they really are, not the name. Everyone has to be respectful and be a human being. No one's above... That's how I carry it with anybody.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"I would run into the corner store, the bodega, and just grab a paper bag or buy juice - anything just to get a paper bag.

Obama's running so we all can fly.,Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg. It's hard to say, 'That guy is less than you.' The kid is like, 'I like that guy, he's cool. How is he less than me?",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"That's why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling, hanging out, having fun, enjoying the same music. Hip-hop is not just in the Bronx anymore. It's worldwide. Everywhere you go, people are listening to hip-hop and partying together. Hip-hop has done that.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,"Successful people have a bigger fear of failure than people who've never done anything because if you haven't been successful, then you don't know how it feels to lose it all. You don't have that fear. So why do you think people get stuck in those boxes? It's that fear of going back down.",Jay-Z,American, Musician ,Primarily I see myself as so much more than a rapper.
