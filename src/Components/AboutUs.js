                In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God. (John 1:1).
                I'm creating this website to collect all the wisdom words, all the inspired words.
                All men are created equal but all words are not created equal. Successful people's quotes can bring
                wisdom, inspiration and love to other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Motto is a phrase that people live by. It can help people to define intention, ethics and principles.
                By looking at other successful people's quotes, we can find our own motto through them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope one day, people will all come to this website looking for wisdom, inspiration, love.
                And I wish it can help people change their life for good.
            </p>
